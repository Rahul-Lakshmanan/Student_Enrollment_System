# Project Information

### Description
This is a fake student management system where you can enroll "students" into a school. Users can navigate through different screens to enroll students with different names into different grades as well as choose different classes. At the end, they will be given a balance that is due depending on how many students they enrolled into the school and what classes they have chosen to participate in.
