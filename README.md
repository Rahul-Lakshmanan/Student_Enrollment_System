# Project Information

### Description
This is a fake student management system where you can "enroll students" into a school. Users can navigate through different screens to enroll students with different names into different grades as well as choose different classes. At the end, they will be given a balance that is due depending on what classes they have chosen to participate in.

### Requirements and Installation  
This program requires no outside installations other than the files provided. To run it, simply download all files under the **Student_Management_System** repository and run any file. 

### Challenges
Learning the nuances of java's frontend tools was a little challenging at first because there were small rules and restrictions that didn't allow the JPanels, JFrames, and container layouts that I used to integrate cohesively. 

I emphasized code and file organization in this project to help make the project more readable and understandble for others.
